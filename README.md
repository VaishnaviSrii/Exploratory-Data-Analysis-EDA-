 Exploratory-Data-Analysis [EDA]

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python. The objective of this project is to explore the dataset visually and statistically to uncover meaningful insights and relationships among the variables.

📁 Files Included
- `titanic.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code
- `README.md` – Project summary and instructions

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


🔍 EDA Tasks Performed
- Summary statistics using `.describe()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()`
- Visualizations:
  - Boxplot
  - Pairplot
  - Heatmap
  - Histogram
  - Scatterplot
- Correlation analysis
- Identification of outliers, trends, and patterns


📈 Key Insights
- Age distribution shows presence of outliers.
- Certain numeric variables have strong correlations.
- Some features show skewed distributions and require normalization.
- Gender distribution can affect other variables like Age or Score.
